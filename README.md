# Statistical Decision Making

This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments exploring various statistical decision-making techniques. These projects are part of a coursework for understanding statistical methods and their applications, and they serve as a foundation for further exploration outside of this scope. Each folder represents a self-contained project, complete with relevant scripts, datasets, and explanations.

## Projects

### 1. Bayesian Inference
This project demonstrates the application of Bayesian inference with uncensored and censored data. It includes:
- Calculation of posterior mean and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates.
- Insights into handling censored data in Bayesian frameworks.

### 2. Newsvendor Problem
A comprehensive analysis of the Newsvendor Problem, including:
- Implementation using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
- Extensions with and without weather considerations.
- Files:
  - `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the solution.
  - `sales.csv`: Sales data used in the analysis.
  - Visualization: `MLE Newsvendor Problem.png`.

### 3. Readmission Prediction to Clinic
An exploration of predictive modeling for patient readmissions using:
- Machine learning techniques to analyze healthcare data.
- Files:
  - `Readmission_Prediction_for_Healthcare.ipynb`: Notebook implementing the model.
  - `readmission.csv`: Dataset containing patient information.
